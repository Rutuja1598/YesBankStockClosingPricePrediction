# YesBankStockClosingPricePrediction

This project aims to predict the monthly closing prices of Yes Bank's stock. In the context of significant events involving the bank, we'll leverage time series models and data analysis to explore how these events impact stock prices. We'll use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn for data manipulation, visualization, and model building. The goal is to gain insights into stock price behavior and create predictive models for informed decision-making in financial markets.
